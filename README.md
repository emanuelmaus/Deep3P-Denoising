## Dataset

- **Description:** The data used in this research project consisted of structural signals of mGFP-labeled intravital glioblastoma cells and their THG signals in the deep layers of the mouse brain, recorded using three-photon microscopy. These data are time-series of 3D volumes showing the temporal changes of glioblastoma cells and its THG signal.
- **Preprocessing:** Before the time-series of 3D-data can be used for training or inference, it must be preprocessed. This includes registration, alignment, and cropping of translational borders. Each single 3D-time stamp is treated separately for the training and inference of the 3PM-N2V. 

## Installation

To install and use these denoising methods, follow these steps:

- Clone the repository using the following command in your terminal:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/emanuelmaus/Deep3P-Denoising.git
```
- Navigate to the cloned repository by using the following command:
```sh
cd Deep3P-Denoising
```
- Install all dependencies by creating a new environment using the [**Deep3P_Denoising.yml**](Deep3P_Denoising.yml):
```sh
conda env create --file Deep3P_Denoising.yml
```
- Activate the new environment:
```sh
conda activate Deep3P_Denoising
```
- To reduce training and inference time, access to a GPU is highly recommended. The (**NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit**)[https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads] and the (**NVIDIA CUDA Deep Neural Network (cuDNN)**)[https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/cudnn/index.html] library are needed to accelerate the processing. Check which (**PyTorch packages**)[https://pytorch.org/] is compatible with the system used by selecting the correct operating system and compute platform. Run the generated command in your terminal. The command will look similar to the following:
```sh
conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio pytorch-cuda=11.6 -c pytorch -c nvidia
``` 
- Navigate to the notebooks containing the denoising methods by using following command:
```sh
cd notebooks
```
- Launch Jupyter-lab by typing ``jupyter-lab`` in your terminal and run the corresponding notebooks.

## How-To-Run


There are three notebooks for **training** ([``01_Training-3PM-Noise2Void.ipynb``](notebooks/01_Training-3PM-Noise2Void.ipyn)), **inference** ([``02_Inference-3PM-Noise2Void.ipynb``](notebooks/02_Inference-3PM-Noise2Void.ipynb)), and **PerStruc-Denoiser** ([``03_PerStruc-Denoiser.ipynb``](notebooks/03_PerStruc-Denoiser.ipynb)).
The sequence of execution is as follows
1. [**Training: 3PM-Noise2Void**](notebooks/01_Training-3PM-Noise2Void.ipyn)
2. [**Inference: 3PM-Noise2Void**](notebooks/02_Inference-3PM-Noise2Void.ipynb) 
3. [**PerStruc-Denoiser**](notebooks/03_PerStruc-Denoiser.ipynb)

Each notebook provides an easy-to-use tutorial on how to use it. Code sections, which can be changed to test new parameters or adapt to new data, are marked as following:
```Python
# Select...    #



#**************#
```
